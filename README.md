# ✈️ Aviation Accident Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This data science initiative will examine worldwide aviation accidents between **01-01-2000 and 01-01-2024**. Using actual-world datasets, we hope to draw significant insights into **severity of accidents**, **fatality rates**, and **aircraft types** and find significant patterns that can help in risk avoidance.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Aviation crash report dataset
- **Format:** CSV
- **Total Records:** Approximately 45,000+
- **Duration:** 24 years (2000-2024)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python, R
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tidyverse

## 🔍 Important Analyses Performed
- Severity classification level
- Fatality rate distribution
- Aircraft type contribution to accident numbers
- t-test to compare means between fatal and non-fatal accidents
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

## 📈 Key Insights

- More severe accidents are likely to involve much higher numbers of fatalities. - A few types of aircraft cause a high proportion of overall crashes. - T-test confirms statistically significant differences in the mortality rates among severity groups. ## ???? Directory Structure

  
## 🧠 Conclusion
This analysis shows how data science can assist in identifying critical factors behind aviation accidents. These insights can be used by policy makers, airlines, and safety regulators to make aviation safer.
